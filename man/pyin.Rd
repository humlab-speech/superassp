\arguments{
\item{listOfFiles}{A vector of file paths to wav files.}

\item{beginTime}{The start time of the section of the sound file that should be processed.}

\item{endTime}{The end time of the section of the sound file that should be processed.}

\item{windowShift}{The measurement interval (frame duration), in seconds.}

\item{minF}{Candidate f0 frequencies below this frequency will not be considered.}

\item{maxF}{Candidates above this frequency will be ignored.}

\item{max_transition_rate}{The maximum pitch transition rate in octaves per second.}

\item{beta_parameters}{The shape parameters for the beta distribution prior over thresholds.}

\item{center}{Should analysis windows be centered around the time of the
window (\code{TRUE}, the default) or should the window be considered to have
started at the indicated time point (\code{FALSE}).}

\item{boltzmann_parameter}{The shape parameter for the Boltzmann distribution prior over troughs. Larger values will assign more mass to smaller periods.}

\item{resolution}{The resolution of the pitch bins. 0.01 corresponds to cents.}

\item{thresholds}{The number of thresholds for peak estimation.}

\item{switch_probability}{The probability of switching from voiced to unvoiced or vice versa.}

\item{no_trough_probability}{The maximum probability to add to global minimum if no trough is below threshold.}

\item{pad_mode}{The mode in which padding occurs. Ignored if \code{center} is not
\code{TRUE}. Padding occurs in the python library librosa, and the user should
therefore consult the manual of the NumPy library function
\href{https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html#numpy-pad}{numpy.pad} for other options.}

\item{explicitExt}{the file extension that should be used.}

\item{outputDirectory}{set an explicit directory for where the signal file will be written. If not defined, the file will be written to the same directory as the sound file.}

\item{toFile}{write the output to a file? The file will be written in  \code{outputDirectory}, if defined, or in the same directory as the soundfile.}
}
\value{
An SSFF track object containing two tracks (f0 and pitch) that are either returned (toFile == FALSE) or stored on disk.

\description{
The probabilistic YIN algorithm
\insertCite{Mauch.2014.10.1109/icassp.2014.6853678}{superassp} is an
extension of \link[=yin]{YIN} \insertCite{Cheveign√©.2002.10.1121/1.1458024}{superassp} that considers multiple pitch
candidates in a hidden Markov model that is Viterbi-decoded to deduce the
final pitch estimate. The function also returns a track encoding whether the
track was considered voiced or not, and a track containing the probability of
voicing in the analysis frame.
}
\details{
This function calls the librosa \insertCite{brian_mcfee_2022_6097378}{superassp} Python library to load the audio data an
make pitch related estimates.
