\title{wrassp - Interface to the ASSP Library}
\description{
wrassp is a wrapper for R around Michel Scheffers's libassp (Advanced Speech Signal Processor).
The libassp library aims at providing functionality for handling speech signal files in most
common audio formats and for performing analyses common in phonetic science/speech science.
This includes the calculation of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean square,
auto correlation, a variety of spectral analyses, zero crossing rate, filtering etc.
This wrapper provides R with a large subset of libassp's signal processing functions and
provides them to the user in a (hopefully) user-friendly manner.

\details{
This package is part of the next iteration of the EMU Speech Database Management System
which aims to be as close to an all-in-one solution for generating, manipulating, querying,
analyzing and managing speech databases as possible.
For an overview of the system please visit this URL: \url{http://ips-lmu.github.io/EMU.html}.
