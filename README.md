# An extended wrassp package

The idea is to make a package that has all the functionality of wrassp, and extend it with analyses made avaiable in Praat or MATLAB. The added functions should behave in a wrassp-like manner, and thereby be callable in a similar way in the `emuR` framwork.

The `praat_formant_burg` provides an illustration of how a Praat script that extracts formant values may be wrapped inside of an R function and produce a SSFF formant track file. 

## Details
By loading this package, you also get all the functions exported by the `wrassp` package into your namespace. This is achieved by the `superassp` package being *Depending*  the `wrassp` package (rather than *Importing*, which is usually the preferred way of creating depmendencies between R packages).
