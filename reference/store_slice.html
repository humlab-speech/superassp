    <p>The primary example of a feature set belonging to a sparse collection of
slices is a large collection of acoustic measurements of voice obtained from
just the portion of the recording where the participant produces a maximally
prolonged vowel. Computing the output may be computationaly intensive, and
applying it across the entire signal just makes no sense for the application.
As an example of this situation, please refer to the <code>vat</code>
function which takes approximately 60x the duration of the sample to
complete, and is only valid for vowel productions. The participant may also
produce more than one prolonged vowel in a recording, and there is therefore
no unified analysis window to apply to the entire speech file (such as what
is the case when constructing a spectrogram from a set of equally spaced
spectral slices). The specification of <code>start_sample</code> and <code>start_sample</code> for
each slice additionaly allows for partially overlapping slices in flexible
way, and can be added to the sparse collection iteratively. The user may, for
instance, apply the analysis to the entire vowel, and then just to a 2s
portion starting 1s into the vowel, and store the results in the same
datafile for later use.</p>
<p>An example of a whole file feature set would be a high-dimensional acoustic
description of an entire speaker or recording. This set is not well suited to
be aligned to a particularportion of the speech signal, and in this case
<code>start_time</code> and <code>start_time</code> is not set (<code>NULL</code>). Even though the the
feature set is alined to a maximally large portion of the speech signal, it
is still considered a slice in the sparse collection of slices.</p>
<p>Sparse collection of slices are flexible, but the implementation of them
assures that two important features are upheld at all times:</p><ol><li><p>The results stored in a sparse collection of slices must be identially
shaped. That is, they may only hold the features defined when you first
insert data into them. It is of course possible to have multiple sparse
collections (with unique file extensions) where the user may store outputs of
different analyses associated with a single speech signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Two slices may not be associated with exacly the same portion of the
speech signal. If the user supplies a new result to the same time slice
(including a slice including the entier file), the old values will be
overwritten. This is to ensure that the user will always be able to deternine
which set of output values is obtained from the just the start and end times
supplied to the <code>get_slicedata</code>, and also assures the most
efficient retrieval of the data. If the user needs to, for instance, apply
the same analysis multiple times to the same portion of the signal file, then
the user should instead use multiple sparse slice collection files.</p></li>
