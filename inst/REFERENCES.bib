abstract = {{Recent estimates of auditory‐filter shape are used to derive a simple formula relating the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) of the auditory filter to center frequency. The value of the auditory‐filter bandwidth continues to decrease as center frequency decreases below 500 Hz. A formula is also given relating ERB‐rate to frequency. Finally, a method is described for calculating excitation patterns from filter shapes.}},
