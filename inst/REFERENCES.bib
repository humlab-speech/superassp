Here, regression equations are presented for the estimation of formant bandwidths based on measurements from natural speech which is based only on formant center frequency and independent of other formant values. Current usage, as well as comparison with another well-known estimation algorithm suggests that the new procedure should be quite acceptable for some types of speech synthesis.}},

To carry out this analysis, a parametric approach is adopted in which voice production is modelled using the traditional source-filter model and the first cepstral peak is assumed to have Gaussian shape. It is concluded that the meaning of CPP is very similar to that of the first rahmonic and some insights are provided on its dependence with fundamental frequency and vocal tract resonances. It is further shown that CPP integrates measures of voice waveform and periodicity perturbations, be them either amplitude, frequency or noise.}},

Twenty listeners rated the degree of breathiness using a direct magnitude estimation procedure. Acoustic measures were made of: (a) signal periodicity, (b) first harmonic amplitude, and (c) spectral tilt. Periodicity measures provided the most accurate predictions of perceived breathiness, accounting for approximately 80\% of the variance in breathiness ratings. The relative amplitude of the first harmonic correlated moderately with breathiness ratings, and two measures of spectral tilt correlated weakly with perceived breathiness.}},

abstract = {{A new method to calculate a spectral harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR) in speech signals is presented. The method involves discrimination between harmonic and noise energy in the magnitude spectrum by means of a comb-liftering operation in the cepstrum domain. Sensitivity of HNR to (a) additive noise and (b) jitter was tested with synthetic vowel-like signals, generated at 10 fundamental frequencies. All jitter and noise signals were analyzed at three window lengths in order to investigate the effect of the length of the analysis frame on the estimated HNR values. Results of a multiple linear regression analysis with noise or jitter, F0, and window length as predictors for HNR indicate a major effect of both noise and jitter on HNR, in that HNR decreases almost linearly with increasing noise levels or increasing jitter. The influence of F0 and window length on HNR is small for the jittered signals, but HNR increases considerably with increasing F0 or window length for the noise signals. We conclude that the method seems to be a valid technique for determining the amount of spectral noise, because it is almost linearly sensitive to both noise and jitter for a large part of the noise or jitter continuum. The strong negative relation between HNR and jitter illustrates that spectral noise measures cannot simply be taken as indicators of the actual amount of noise in the time signal. Instead, HNR integrates several aspects of the acoustic stability of the signal. As such, HNR may be a useful parameter in the analysis of voice quality, although it cannot be directly interpreted in terms of underlying glottal events or perceptual characteristics.}},

abstract = {{The Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI) and the Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI) have been successfully investigated to quantify voice quality. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of both measurements in comparison with the dysphonia classification. In total, 264 subjects with vocally healthy voices (n = 105) and with various voice disorders (n = 159) were included in the study. To determine the dysphonia classification, all subjects underwent a videolaryngostroboscopy and, if necessary, a direct microlaryngoscopy plus a clinical examination to diagnose a voice disorder. Patients with a vocally healthy voice had no actual voice complaints, no history of chronic laryngeal diseases or voice disorders, no hearing problems and were determined as healthy voices by clinical voice specialists. To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy, receiver operating characteristic statistics and correct classification rate (CCR) were used. The diagnostic accuracy of DSI and AVQI showed strong sensitivity and specificity in the determination of dysphonia classification. A DSI threshold of 3.05 obtained a high sensitivity of 94.3\% and specificity of 84.3\%. An CCR of 88\% was determined for DSI. Also, an AVQI threshold of 3.31 showed reasonable sensitivity of 71.7\% and specificity of 88\%. The CCR for AVQI was 79\%. Although DSI and AVQI were developed to quantify voice quality, the present results showed that both measurements can evaluate the dysphonia classification as well. Particularly, the DSI might have higher potential in the evaluation of dysphonia classification. 2C Laryngoscope, 129:692–698, 2019}},

To be more generally applied, however, implementation of DSI in the program Praat (Paul Boersma and David Weenink, Institute for Phonetic Sciences, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands) would be advantageous for all voice clinicians. The presented project was therefore designed (1) to develop such a Praat application and (b) to test its concurrent validity.MethodsThe four voice markers for the original DSI, as well as ten additional voice markers in Praat, were administered on a total of 49 subjects in three different clinical voice centers. A crossover research design was implemented to counterbalance for possible exercise effects. First, stepwise multiple linear regression was applied to build a statistical model with the best combination of Praat predictors for the original DSI. Second, correlation statistics were applied to compare Praat's DSI with the original DSI.ResultsBoth DSI versions correlated strongly. A custom script was therefore written for automated DSI determination in Praat.ConclusionWith this script, every voice clinician can easily determine DSI in the Praat program.}},

The DSI is based on the weighted combination of the following selected set of voice measurements: highest frequency (F(0)-High in Hz), lowest intensity (I-Low in dB), maximum phonation time (MPT in s), and jitter (\%). The DSI is derived from a multivariate analysis of 387 subjects with the goal of describing, purely based on objective measures, the perceived voice quality. It is constructed as DSI = 0.13 x MPT + 0.0053 x F(0)-High - 0.26 x I-Low - 1.18 x Jitter (\%) + 12.4. The DSI for perceptually normal voices equals +5 and for severely dysphonic voices -5. The more negative the patient's index, the worse is his or her vocal quality. As such, the DSI is especially useful to evaluate therapeutic evolution of dysphonic patients. Additionally, there is a high correlation between the DSI and the Voice Handicap Index score.}},

Results Fourteen articles were included for the final analysis. The normative value of DSI equals 3.05 with confidential range 2.13–3.98 was received for group of 1330 of healthy subjects whose voices were judged as normal, with range age 17.3–94 years. Conclusions As DSI value is stable over subject groups and used as a diagnostic tool for adults a thorough systematic review of the literature is required to assess the normative value of DSI.

Both varieties of Portuguese display some cross-linguistically common phenomena: vowel-intrinsic duration, vowel-intrinsic pitch, gender-dependent size of the vowel space, gender-dependent duration, and a skewed symmetry in F1 between front and back vowels. Also, the average difference between the vocal tract sizes associated with /i/ and /u/, as measured from formant analyses, is comparable to the average difference between male and female vocal tract sizes. A language-specific phenomenon is that in both varieties of Portuguese the vowel-intrinsic duration effect is larger than in many other languages. Differences between BP and EP are found in duration (BP has longer stressed vowels than EP), in F1 (the lower-mid front vowel approaches its higher-mid counterpart more closely in EP than in BP), and in the size of the intrinsic pitch effect (larger for BP than for EP).}},
