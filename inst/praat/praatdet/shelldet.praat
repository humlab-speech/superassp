## shelldet.praat: wrapper script to get Oq values for multiple files in a single directory from command line
#
## James Kirby <j.kirby@ed.ac.uk>
## last update: 17 August 2018

## If something goes wrong, you can stop the script and pick up where you 
## left off, by noting the last file in the Strings list that was correctly 
## processed. However be sure to rename your output file, or rename it 
## something new when you restart, or you will overwrite your previous data.

#########################
## USER-DEFINED VARIABLES
#########################

## - directory: path to EGG files
## - textgrid: path to TextGrids, if applicable (default: same as directory$)
## - outfile: name of output file (saved in directory$)
## - extension: file extension for EGG files (.wav, .egg...)
## - eggChan: channel number of EGG signal
## - intervalTier, intervalLabel, intervalNum: used to specify a specific
##   portion of the file to edit/extract from. if intervalNum <> 0, this 
##   will take precedence over intervalLabel. if intervalLabel == "" and
##   intervalNum == 0, entire file will be processed.

## - minF0, maxF0: minimum and maximum pitch values
## - k: used to calculate window size for smoothing.
##   k = 0 is same as no smoothing.
##   k = 2 > 5-point window; k = 3 > 7-point window; etc.
## - threshold: Howard's method threshold (default: 3/7)
